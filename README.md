This project explores the application of  machine learning algorithms to predict stock market trends using the Weekly.csv file, which contains weekly stock market returns spanning 21 years from 1990 to 2010. 

The dataset includes predictors such as lagged stock market returns (Lag1 to Lag5) and trading volume, today and direction. 

Overall, this project provides insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction and highlights the importance of feature selection and model evaluation in building accurate predictive models

main objectives were to analyze patterns in the data, build predictive models, and compare the performance of logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and naive Bayes classifiers.
